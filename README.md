This package contains my personal dotfiles, using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to
manage them.

To Install:

```
 cd ~
 git clone git@github.com:ungood/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
 cd .dotfiles
 ./install.sh
```

To configure things for a specific host, add a .zshrc_local file, examples of which are in the local directory.
